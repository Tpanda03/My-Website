        <p>Date: 11/05/2025</p>
        
        <h3>Key Themes from the Research:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Apple's transformation from near-bankruptcy to cultural icon</li>
            <li>The shift from beige boxes to colorful, design-focused computers</li>
            <li>"Think Different" campaign and its cultural impact</li>
            <li>iMac's introduction in 1998 - "It will set the new gold standard and it is beautiful"</li>
            <li>How Apple changed perception of computers from tools to lifestyle/identity statements</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Notable Quote from Research:</h3>
        <p>"The 1990s were such a defining decade in the rise of the internet as we know it and the
        personal computing culture. While many companies like Microsoft and AOL have helped shape
        the technical foundation of the early fragmented web; Apple would influence the way people
        creatively could connect with it."</p>
        
        <h3>Research Conclusion:</h3>
        <p>"Apple did not just participate in this evolution of internet culture as we
        know; it was the brand that created and propelled the internet as we know it today."</p>
