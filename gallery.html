        <h2>The Beige Era (Early 90s)</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>From Micah's research: "At the beginning of the 90s, Apple was in a very difficult position... 
            machines were often seen as work-focused devices that should be intended for spreadsheets,
            business software, and dull word processing."</p>
            
            <p>"At a time when most computers were very beige, boxy looking, and visually ugly..."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The iMac G3 (1998)</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>From Micah's research: "The most iconic embodiment of Apple's late-90s philosophy officially arrived in 1998
            with the initial release of the iMac G3... the iMac introduced transparency and playful futuristic aesthetic.
            The iMace felt 'alive'."</p>
            
            <p>Steve Jobs quote from the research: "It will set the new gold standard and it is beautiful"</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>"Think Different" Campaign</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>From Micah's research: "The marketing included having ads with historical figures such as Einstein, MLK, and Amelia
            Earhart. This really positioned Apple customers not as ordinary computer users, but made them
            feel as individuals who challenged normal convention and reshaped the world itself."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>From Micah's research: "Apple's approach really demonstrated that aesthetics were not just superficial, but rather
            central to shaping how people felt about innovations such as computers and the internet. Design
            became a means of creating emotional connection and overall cultural belonging."</p>
            
            <p>"For example, creating the minimal interfaces, friendly fonts styles, and colorful devices made the technology
            feel personalized and welcoming to the users; countering the clunky intimidating aura of many
            early PCs."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Cultural Impact</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>As referenced in Micah's paper - Paolo Magaudda: "The fascination that Apple's objects have exerted on contemporary society is the outcome of the
            interaction between various elements that are simultaneously technological and cultural,
            symbolic and material."</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>The Internet Connection</h2>
        <div class="description">
            <p>From Micah's research: "The slogan 'three steps & you are on the internet' addressed an initial major barrier of
            the time which was the difficulty many households had getting online."</p>
