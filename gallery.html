            <h2>The Beige Era (Early 1990s)</h2>
            <div class="ad-text">
                At the beginning of the 90s, Apple was in a very difficult position. The company was in serious financial turmoil. The mainstream computing world was still dominated by Microsoft and the IBM-compatible PCs. These machines were often seen as work-focused devices that should be intended for spreadsheets, business software, and dull word processing.<br><br>
                At a time when most computers were very beige, boxy looking, and visually ugly......

                <b>Steve Jobs Quote:</b><br><br>
                "It will set the new gold standard and it is beautiful" - Steve Jobs, 1998<br><br>
                
                <b>From Micah's Research:</b><br>
                The most iconic embodiment of Apple's late-90s philosophy officially arrived in 1998 with the initial release of the iMac G3. At a time when most computers were very beige, boxy looking, and visually ugly......the iMac introduced transparency and playful futuristic aesthetic. The iMace felt "alive". It also really centered the internet as a primary purpose for having a home computer for the family to use.

            <h2>"Think Different" Campaign</h2>
            <div class="ad-text">
                <b>The Campaign That Changed Everything</b><br><br>
                The real cultural turning point of Apple came in the late 90s with the well-known launch of the "Think Different" marketing campaign. Rather than really highlighting technical specifications or other productivity features......Apple celebrated visionary thinking.<br><br>
                
                The marketing included having ads with historical figures such as Einstein, MLK, and Amelia Earhart. This really positioned Apple customers not as ordinary computer users, but made them feel as individuals who challenged normal convention and reshaped the world itself.

                <b>Key Slogan from the Research:</b><br><br>
                The slogan "three steps & you are on the internet" addressed an initial major barrier of the time which was the difficulty many households had getting online. The iMac really had a simplified setup and first interactions; making connectivity really feel accessible to all families, students, and users in general.

            <h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
            <div class="ad-text">
                Apple's approach really demonstrated that aesthetics were not just superficial, but rather central to shaping how people felt about innovations such as computers and the internet. Design became a means of creating emotional connection and overall cultural belonging. For example, creating the minimal interfaces, friendly fonts styles, and colorful devices made the technology feel personalized and welcoming to the users; countering the clunky intimidating aura of many early PCs.
