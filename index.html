        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        The 1990s were such a defining decade in the rise of the internet as we know it and the
        personal computing culture. While many companies like Microsoft and AOL have helped shape
        the technical foundation of the early fragmented web; Apple would influence the way people
        creatively could connect with it. Throughout the late 1990s, Apple really evolved from a
        struggling "tech bro" company near a collapse to the huge cultural symbol associated with
        simplistic artistic expression with a vision with the human-centered vision of technology in
        mind.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        This transformation was not completely driven by hardware, but by a much broader
        cultural shift in how people would eventually view technology's role in our daily lives. Apple
        positioned such computers and the internet as a whole; not just as tools for big business or
        tedious academic work, but rather as gateways to unlimited creativity, communications, and
        individual personal identity.

        <h2>Key Quote from Steve Jobs (1998)</h2>
        <blockquote>
        "It will set the new gold standard and it is beautiful"
        <br>- Steve Jobs, introducing the iMac G3
        </blockquote>
        
        <h2>The Transformation</h2>
        <p>
        At the beginning of the 90s, Apple was in a very difficult position. The company was in
        serious financial turmoil. The company was not competing like they hoped they would. Although
        the company had a great presence in schools and other creative industries; the mainstream
        computing world was still dominated by Microsoft and the IBM-compatible PCs.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Research Focus</h2>
        <p>
        How Apple's 1990s transformation from near-bankruptcy to cultural icon shaped our modern 
        relationship with technology. From computers as tools to computers as identity. From beige 
        boxes to lifestyle statements. This is the story of how Apple made tech "cool" and changed 
        internet culture forever.
