                        The 1990s were such a defining decade in the rise of the internet as we know it and the
                        personal computing culture. While many companies like Microsoft and AOL have helped shape
                        the technical foundation of the early fragmented web; Apple would influence the way people
                        creatively could connect with it. Throughout the late 1990s, Apple really evolved from a
                        struggling "tech bro" company near a collapse to the huge cultural symbol associated with
                        simplistic artistic expression with a vision with the human-centered vision of technology in
                        mind.

                        At the beginning of the 90s, Apple was in a very difficult position. The company was in
                        serious financial turmoil. The company was not competing like they hoped they would. Although
                        the company had a great presence in schools and other creative industries; the mainstream
                        computing world was still dominated by Microsoft and the IBM-compatible PCs. These
                        machines were often seen as work-focused devices that should be intended for spreadsheets,
                        business software, and dull word processing.

                        The huge decisive turning point came in late 1997, when the well known Steve Jobs
                        returned to the company Apple following its acquisition of "NeXT". Jobs did not just simply
                        restructure the entire company; he redefined its whole purpose. With that being said his approach
                        worked.....in the article iMac leads Retail Sales (1998) explicitly states that "iMac's rankings
                        have steadily improved, moving from fourth place in August, to third in September and second
                        in October."

                        The most iconic embodiment of Apple's late-90s philosophy officially arrived in 1998
                        with the initial release of the iMac G3. At a time when most computers were very beige, boxy
                        looking, and visually ugly......the iMac introduced transparency and playful futuristic aesthetic.
                        The iMace felt "alive". The slogan "three steps & you are on the internet" addressed an initial major barrier of
                        the time which was the difficulty many households had getting online.
