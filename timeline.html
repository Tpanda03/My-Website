            <p>Apple was in serious financial turmoil. The company was not competing like they hoped. 
            The mainstream computing world was still dominated by Microsoft and IBM-compatible PCs.</p>

        <div class="event">
            <div class="date">Late 1997</div>
            <p>The huge decisive turning point came when Steve Jobs returned to Apple following its acquisition of "NeXT". 
            Jobs did not just simply restructure the entire company; he redefined its whole purpose.</p>

            <div class="date">Late 90s</div>
            <p>Launch of the "Think Different" marketing campaign. Rather than highlighting technical
            specifications or productivity features, Apple celebrated visionary thinking.</p>

            <div class="date">1998</div>
            <p>The iMac G3 officially arrived. Steve Jobs introduces it saying "It will set the new gold standard and it is beautiful".</p>
            <p>As noted in the article "iMac leads Retail Sales" (1998): "iMac's rankings have steadily improved, 
            moving from fourth place in August, to third in September and second in October."</p>

        <div class="event">
            <div class="date">Key Marketing Messages</div>
            <p>The slogan "three steps & you are on the internet" addressed an initial major barrier of
            the time which was the difficulty many households had getting online.</p>
